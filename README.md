## About the Application

This is a simple app that can calculate the chunk borders(to-from points) based on the player's current location. It can also give you the nether location of the given coordinates for the purpose of linking nether portals.

I mainly made this app in order to learn how to apply a GUI to my projects and later make it run by itself, without my IDE's support.
